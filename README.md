# [Project 1: Data Visualisation and Analysis](https://github.com/lolorangey/DataViz-AnalysisCaseStudy)

This is a project I did for my Master's Advanced Business Intelligence Class. It was done in pairs and we decided to use a case study found from [here](https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test).

* Used a Food Retail dataset and generated visualisations based on consumer demographics and purchasing patterns.
* Cleaned the data with Python Numpy and Pandas
* Used Tableau's built-in clustering functionality
* Used Storyboards for presentation 

Through the EDA stage, we discovered insights that could be useful for business decisions and presented them to the class.

# [Project 2: Tech Job Salary Prediction using R](https://github.com/lolorangey/TechJobSalaryPred)

This project is part of my Business Statistics Using R class in my Masters. This is a group project and we aimed to predict the Salary of a Tech Job/Position with the features from the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/jobs-dataset-from-glassdoor?select=salary_data_cleaned.csv). 

* We conducted a regression analysis using SVM, Multiple Linear Regression and WLS Regression
