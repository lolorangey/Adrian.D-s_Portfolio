# [Project 1: Data Visualisation and Analysis](https://github.com/lolorangey/DataViz-AnalysisCaseStudy)

This is a project I did for my Master's Advanced Business Intelligence Class. It was done in pairs and we decided to use a case study found from [here](https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test).

* Used a Food Retail dataset and generated visualisations based on consumer demographics and purchasing patterns.
* Cleaned the data with Python Numpy and Pandas
* Used Tableau's built-in clustering functionality
* Used Storyboards for presentation 

Through the EDA stage, we discovered insights that could be useful for business decisions and presented them to the class.

# [Project 2: Tech Job Salary Prediction using R](https://github.com/lolorangey/TechJobSalaryPred)

This project is part of my Business Statistics Using R class in my Masters. This is a group project and we aimed to predict the Salary of a Tech Job/Position with the features from the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/jobs-dataset-from-glassdoor?select=salary_data_cleaned.csv). 

* Carried out Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Selection
* Conducted a regression analysis using SVM, Multiple Linear Regression and WLS Regression
* Tested the assumptions of regression

# [Project 3: Car Emissions EPA Target Classification](https://github.com/lolorangey/CarEmissionClassification)

This project aims to predict whether a car with its given specifications and features would fit the EPA Target of 40 MPG by 2026. It was originally done for my Machine Learning using RapidMiner class for my Master's. It is then adapted into python and used H2O's AutoML library for classification. This notebook skips through the feature selection process that was used in our RapidMiner process as well as any analysis and discussions. You can refer to this [document](https://github.com/lolorangey/adrian-s_portfolio/blob/main/Images/Car%20Emission%20Machine%20Learning%20Report.pdf).

* Data Cleaning and PreProcessing
* Feature Engineering
* AutoML resulted in Generalised Linear Model
