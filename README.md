# [Project 1: Data Visualisation and Analysis](https://github.com/lolorangey/DataViz-AnalysisCaseStudy)

This is a project I did for my master's Advanced Business Intelligence Class. It was done in pairs and we decided to use a case study found from [here](https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test).

* Used a Food Retail dataset and generated visualisations based on consumer demographics and purchasing patterns.
* Cleaned the data with Python Numpy and Pandas
* Used Tableau's built-in clustering functionality
* Used Storyboards for presentation
